  title: Admin REST API
  version: '6.5'
  description: |
    The Admin REST API is a secondary API provided by the Query service.
    This API enables you to retrieve statistics about the clusters and nodes running the Query service; view or specify service-level settings; and view or delete requests.

    The API schemes and host URLs are as follows:{blank}

    * `+http://node:8093/+`
    * `+https://node:18093/+` (for secure access)

    where [.var]`node` is the host name or IP address of a computer running the N1QL query engine.
